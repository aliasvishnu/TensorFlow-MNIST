# TensorFlow-MNIST
Simple TensorFlow code to solve MNIST


This is the beginner code for TensorFlow. I uploaded both logistic regression and Convolutional Neural Net version. The accuracies are 92.16% vs 99.2%. I will soon add comments for easy reading. An explanation can also be found on Google's TensorFlow guide page.
